linkedlists
===========
This package contains source code for thread-safe singly-linked and doubly-linked lists. The SinglyLinkedList has only
a pointer to the front of the list while the DoublyLinkedList has pointers to both the front and back of the list.
The implementation makes use of interface values in Go to make both lists as generic as possible.
